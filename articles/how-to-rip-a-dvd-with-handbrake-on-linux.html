<p>Handbrake is a powerful open-source tool for encoding and editing video.
	It includes a graphical control panel to manage your encodes and even
	preview the result. Part of what makes Handbrake such a favorite in the
	Linux world is its ability to encode off of a DVD, effectively making it
	one of the best tools available for ripping DVDs.</p>
<p>The legality of ripping DVDs can be murky in some countries. The purpose of
	this article is to inform you how to make archival copies of DVDs that you
	legally own, but be sure to check the laws in your area before continuing.</p>
<p><strong>Do note that Handbrake is also available for Windows and macOS.</strong></p>
<h2>Install Handbrake</h2>
<p>Everything here relies on Handbrake, but there’s another piece you’ll need
	too. The VLC developers created a library, libdvdcss, for decoding
	copyright-protected DVDs for playback. Handbrake relies on it to decode
	DVDs, too, so you’ll need it as well.</p>
<h3>Ubuntu, Mint, Pop!OS</h3>
<p>Ubuntu does have Handbrake in its repositories, but due to the legal
	grayness of libdvdcss, it’s not in the repositories. Instead, Ubuntu
	provides a script to build the package yourself. Don’t worry, it’s all
	automatic. Start by installing libdvd-pkg, the script package.</p>
<code>sudo apt install libdvd-pkg</code><br><br>
<img src="../img/articles/how-to-rip-a-dvd-with-handbrake-on-linux/handbrake-install-libdvd-pop-os.webp">
<p>A menu will pop up in the terminal asking if you want to continue. Agree to
	everything and keep going. When it’s done, you’ll need to reconfigure the
	package to build and install libdvdcss.</p>
<code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure libdvd-pkg</code><br><br>
<img src="../img/articles/how-to-rip-a-dvd-with-handbrake-on-linux/handbrake-dpkg-reconfigure-libdvd-pop-os.webp">
<p>Finally, install Handbrake.</p>
<code>sudo apt install handbrake</code>
<h3>Fedora</h3>
<p>Both packages are available on Fedora through the RPM Fusion repository.
	Start by enabling it on your system.</p>
<code>sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm</code>
<p>libdvdcss is found in the separate “tainted” RPM Fusion repo. You’ll need to
	add that too via a package from the regular RPM Fusion.</p>
<code>sudo dnf install rpmfusion-free-release-tainted</code><br><br>
<img src="../img/articles/how-to-rip-a-dvd-with-handbrake-on-linux/handbrake-install-libdvdcss-fedora.webp">
<p>Now you can install Handbrake and libdvdcss.</p>
<code>sudo dnf install libdvdcss handbrake-gui</code>
<h3>Arch Linux</h3>
<p>Arch Linux has both packages in its regular repositories. Just install them.</p>
<code>sudo pacman -S libdvdcss handbrake</code>
<h2>Rip a DVD</h2>
<img src="../img/articles/how-to-rip-a-dvd-with-handbrake-on-linux/handbrake-running.webp">
<p>Open Handbrake. You can find it under the “Multimedia” category on your
	application menu. When Handbrake opens, it might look overwhelming at
	first, but it’s actually fairly simple, when you break it down.</p>
<h3>Load the Source</h3>
<img src="../img/articles/how-to-rip-a-dvd-with-handbrake-on-linux/handbrake-select-source.webp">
<p>A new window will open for you to browse to your source. There are a couple
	shortcuts to your DVD drive. First, if you already have your DVD in the
	drive, it should appear with the DVD’s title on the left of the window.
	Click on it and select “VIDEO_TS” to open.</p>
<p>You can also use the “Detected DVD devices” drop-down at the bottom of the
	window. It’ll probably have your drive selected already, so you can just
	open it right from there. If not, you can usually find your drive under the
	drop-down. It’s usually a drive letter like “/dev/sr0.”</p>
<p>After you select it, your drive will spin and start reading your DVD. A
	progress bar will pop up at the top of the Handbrake window as it loads
	your DVD. When it’s done, you’ll see your DVD’s title listed as the source
	in the upper-left.</p>
<h3>Select the Preset</h3>
<img src="../img/articles/how-to-rip-a-dvd-with-handbrake-on-linux/handbrake-source-loaded.webp">
<p>Handbrake has presets with common aspect ratios, frame rates, and support
	for certain devices. You’ll find the preset list in the upper-right corner
	of the Handbrake window.</p>
<p>Scroll through and see what looks best for your use. If you’re just looking
	to make a copy of your DVD, you can select the “Fast 1080p30” preset as a
	good default. It will produce a quality 1080p copy of your DVD. If your DVD
	is an older standard definition DVD, Handbrake will use the native
	dimensions of the DVD and copy it as is.</p>
<h3>Add Titles to the Queue</h3>
<img src="../img/articles/how-to-rip-a-dvd-with-handbrake-on-linux/handbrake-titles.webp">
<p>Turn your attention back to the upper-left corner of the screen. Take a look
	at the “Title” drop-down directly under the “Source” label with your DVD’s
	title.</p>
<p>DVDs are broken up into titles. These are the individual videos on the DVD,
	and most of them are just garbage from the menus. It’s up to you to pick
	out the titles that contain the actual content that you want. The easiest
	way to do so is with the duration of the title. If your DVD is a movie, you
	can find the title with the same run time as the full film. If you’re
	looking for the episodes of a TV show, find titles that last about as long
	as one. They should all be fairly uniform. When you have your title,
	select it.</p>
<p>Below the title drop-down, take a look under the “Destination” header. There
	you can name your file. Under that, you can choose the destination for your
	video. You can place it anywhere with enough free space.</p>

<p>After everything looks good, press the “Add To Queue” button in the menu
	across the top of your window. It’s right next to the “Open Source” one. If
	you’re doing TV episodes, repeat these steps for each episode, adding each
	one to the queue.</p>
<h3>Rip!</h3>
<img src="../img/articles/how-to-rip-a-dvd-with-handbrake-on-linux/handbrake-queue.webp">
<p>Now that you have all of the titles that you want to back up in your queue,
	you can start ripping. If you’d like to double-check your queue, click the
	“Show Queue” button in the top menu. It’ll display all of your enqueued
	titles and the output file names.</p>
<p>Click “Start Encoding” in the top menu to start ripping your DVD. Handbrake
	will take a decent amount of time, depending on your CPU and DVD drive
	speeds, to work its way through your selected titles. When it’s done,
	it’ll show you a success message. At that point you’re free to eject your
	DVD and/or close Handbrake.</p>
<p>Congrats! You’re now ready to back up your DVDs or view them digitally on
	your devices. Remember to check the laws in your area before doing this,
	and never illegally distribute duplicated DVDs.</p>
