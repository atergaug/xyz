<article>
<p>Here are the programs and equipment I use for everything. I'm
only putting here methods I consider tried and true and have used for a
while.</p>
<h2>Hardware I Use</h2>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://amzn.to/3o5cE23">External DVD/CD Drive</a></dt>
<dd>USB 2.0 interface. Multi-region support. Combination of CD-R/RW,
DVD-R/RW, DVD+R/RW, DVD+R DL, DVD-R, DL and DVD-RAM drive functions into
one drive.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://amzn.to/3IJtWeJ">SATA to USB Cable</a></dt>
<dd>USB 3.0 interface. Backup data from 2.5" and 3.5" drives via USB.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://amzn.to/3AQdqI1">Microphone</a></dt>
<dd>I record most of my audio with a Razer Seiren Mini, people in comms say it
	sounds quality. Compared to other microphones under $100, I preferred
	the warm and bassy sound signature of the Seiren Mini. It does the job
	without having to postprocess the midrange or bass of voice recordings.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Software I Use</h2>
<h3>Priorities</h3>
<p>I'm about getting things done reasonably quick and secure. I don't mind
	sacrificing convenience for privacy/security as long as it is reliable.</p>
<p>I like having MacOS-like bindings and have no preference running programs in
	the terminal or graphical interface. That said, I'm against the meme that
	things in the terminal are "cooler" or "nerdier". Terminals are good for
	most tasks, but useless for others, such as web browsing or looking at maps
	or images or modifying videos by NLE. Image/video editing can be done with
	<code>imagemagick</code>/<code>ffmpeg</code>, but only simple, repetitive
	tasks.</p>
<h3>Basic</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Operating System/Distribution</dt>
<dd>I use Pop!OS(<a href="https://pop.system76.com/">site</a>) which is a fork
	of Ubuntu primarily maintained by System76. Linux distributions are
	generally not distinct enough to have strong feelings about.</a></dd>
<dt>Terminal</dt>
<dd>I use terminator
	(<a href="https://github.com/gnome-terminator/terminator">site</a>),
	which is one of the most extensible, yet easily customizable terminal
	emulators out there.</dd>
<dt>Shell</dt>
<dd>I use bash as a shell however, moving to zsh in the future as it has pretty
	much all of the features of bash with additional plugins for more advanced
	auto-completion and syntax coloring.</dd>
<dt>Window Manager/Desktop Environment</dt>
<dd>Openbox.</dd>
<dt>Text editing and programming</dt>
<dd><a href="https://vscodium.com/">VSCodium</a>. Built from Microsoft’s vscode
	source code exception telemetry/tracking is disabled.</dd>
<dt>Web browser</dt>
<dd>Brave Browser is usable and private out of the box. I often recommend the following
add-ons:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">uBlock
Origin</a></li>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/decentraleyes/ldpochfccmkkmhdbclfhpagapcfdljkj?hl=en-US">Decentraleyes</a></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Utilities</h3>
<dl>
<dt>File manager</dt>
<dd><a href="https://github.com/linuxmint/nemo">Nemo</a> and
	<a href="https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start">Thunar</a>.</dd>
<dt>Video player</dt>
<dd><a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv</a>. Don't bother with any other video player.</dd>
<dt>RSS reader</dt>
<dd><a href="https://newsboat.org/">newsboat</a>, <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.nononsenseapps.feeder/">Feeder</a>.</dd>
<dt>Torrent client</dt>
<dd><a href="https://www.tixati.com/">Tixati</a>.</dd>
