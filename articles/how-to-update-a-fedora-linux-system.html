<header><h1>How To Update a Fedora Linux System</h1></header>
<article>
<strong>This quick tutorial shows one way to update a Fedora Linux install.</strong>
<p>I’ll be honest with you, I didn’t have much experience with Linux
	distributions. Trying Fedora was a different kind of experience for me.</p>
<p>The first thing I did after installing Fedora was to try and install some
	software. I opened the software center and found that the software center
	was ‘broken’. I couldn’t install any application from it.</p>
<p>Sometimes we just ignore the updates and keep troubleshooting the issue we
	face. No matter how big/small the issue is – to avoid them, you should keep
	your system up-to-date.</p>
<p>For some reason, I cannot reliably load up the software center, so I prefer
	to utilize the dnf package managing commands to easily update the system.
	<strong>There are various possible methods to update your Fedora Linux system (i.e.
	from the software center or system settings) however, I will only cover the
	command line method.</strong></p>
<h3 id="free-and-open-source-software">Looking for Fedora version upgrade?</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that updating Fedora means installing the security patches,
	kernel updates and software updates. If you want to update from one version
	of Fedora to another, it is called version upgrade and <strong>that is
	beyond the scope of the procedures here.</strong></p>
<h2 id="is-brave-bad-for-privacy">Updating Fedora Using The Terminal</h2>
<p>Simply launch the terminal and type in the following command to start
	updating (you should be prompted to verify the root password):</p>
<code>sudo dnf upgrade</code>
<h3 id="it-must-actually-work-on-the-modern-web">dnf update vs dnf upgrade</h3>
<p>You’ll find that there are two dnf commands available: dnf update and dnf
	upgrade. Both command do the same job and that is to install all the
	updates provided by Fedora. Then why there is dnf update and dnf upgrade
	and which one should you use? Well, dnf update is basically an alias to dnf
	upgrade. While dnf update may still work, the good practice is to use dnf
	upgrade because that is the real command.</p>
